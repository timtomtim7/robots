Tasks [

    Robots have a list of tasks that it can carry out.
    A robot figures out what it should be doing per situation on it's own,
    it has a mind of it's own and should know how to help when you need it.
    Some of the things it could be able to aid a player in are:
    * Mining - if a player starts mining, the robot should know how to help.
    * Killing - if a player is engaging in PvP/PvE, the robot should understand this and help.
    * Farming - If a player is breaking crops or placing crops, the robot should help.
    * Tree Chopping - If a player is chopping trees down, the robot should chop nearby trees down as well.

    Some tasks are rather arbitrary. He'll play these tasks out when the player
    isn't doing something that the robot knows he should help, like when the robot
    is just kind of wandering around. Some of these could be:
    * Chest Organization - It could organize nearby chests.

    Some tasks are more "demands" by the player that the robot should carry out.
    Some of these demands could be:
    * Crafting - The player could ask the robot to craft it a diamond sword with materials either given to it or from
    materials collected from nearby inventories.
    * Item Requests - The player could ask the robot to get it some dirt and the robot would go find items from nearby
    inventories and return them to the player.

    * Enchantment Requests - The player could ask the robot to enchant an item they are holding and the robot would
    find the nearest enchantment table and enchant it with the highest level possible.

Controlling the Robot [

    Robots would be interacted with through chat.
    The player would address the robot by saying his name and his request, like..
    "Hey Tom, can you please enchant this diamond sword for me?" - this would trigger the robot to enact on it's Enchantment Request task.
    "Tom, I need some dirt." - this would trigger the robot to enact on it's Item Requests task.
